# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Machine Learning project for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions
## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques.

## Problem Statement
The goal is to build a binary classification model to identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false negatives.

## Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- SMOTE for class imbalance
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Model Evaluation (Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC)

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Imbalanced-learn

## Conclusion
The Random Forest model performed better in detecting fraud cases with improved recall and ROC-AUC score.
